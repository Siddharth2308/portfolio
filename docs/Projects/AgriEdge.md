## Overview
THe device can intercept data from over 150+ weather stations. It is capable of acting as an independedn weather node
as well as a repeater. Suppors 433 Mhz based OOK (On-Off Keyring) modulation debugging. It is a embedded SDR tool that supports WiFI, BLE, LoRa and GSM.

## Salient Features
- **Multi-Band Capability:**
  - Supports **433 MHz**, **868 MHz LoRa**, and **GSM** for data transmission and reception.
- **Intercepts Weather Station Data:**
  - Compatible with 180+ weather stations transmitting on 433 MHz.
- **Onboard Processor:**
  - Capable of running **TinyML models** for intelligent data processing.
- **Peripheral Connectivity:**
  - Equipped with **I2C** and **SPI** interfaces for additional peripherals.
- **Real-Time Clock (RTC):**
  - Ensures timekeeping and synchronous data transmission.
- **Network Debugging Tool:**
  - Can also be used for diagnosing and debugging networks.
- **USB-C Connection:**
  - Provides higher power delivery and faster data rates.


### Key Issues in Agricultural Data Collection

- **Limitations of IMD Weather Data:**
  - IMD stations typically cover one per district, resulting in poor spatial resolution.
  - Weather data is unreliable for farms far from the station.

- **Accessing Data Locally:**
  - Farmers struggle to access data without using company-specific proprietary hardware.
  - Most weather stations only provide basic data visualization and storage with limited remote access options.

- **Cost of Commercial Weather Stations:**
  - Prices range from ₹10,000 to ₹2,00,000+, making them unaffordable for many farmers.
