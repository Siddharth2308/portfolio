| <img width="600" alt="agriedge" src="../images/projects/r1.png">The task of the robot was to throw the type 1 Balls to break the lagori. and to target the opponents Ball on head. The Robot was semi automatic with full automatic mode. I was responsible for the programming and electronics of the robot. We used ARM M7 based microcontroller Teensy 4.1. This Robot is a complete closed loop system with an active feedback to each mechanism. I was the operator of this robot in the official Competition. | <img width="1000" alt="CL" src="../images/projects/r2.jpg"> This robot was designed for the theme of Robocon 2022, the task of the robot was to pile with broken lagori while balancing the ball on head.
